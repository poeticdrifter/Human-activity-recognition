# Human-activity-recognition
Machine learning models to recognize the activity of a person based on the activities carried out. Sensors were used to collect the data from different users while they were doing their regular works. Problem statement: Perform exploratory data analysis to check for: Build a machine learning model to classify the data Cluster the data using K-Means clustering algorithm. The value of K shouldnâ€™t be based on the given class information. Instead, use elbow criteria to find the optimal value for K to cluster the data. Compare the results of both classification and clustering techniques. Check of there are any false negative, false positive cases.
